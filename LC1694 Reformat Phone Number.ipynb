    "### LC1694_Reformat Phone Number\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a phone number as a string number. number consists of digits, spaces ' ', and/or dashes '-'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would like to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits. The final digits are then grouped as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 digits: A single block of length 2.\n",
    "3 digits: A single block of length 3.\n",
    "4 digits: Two blocks of length 2 each.\n",
    "The blocks are then joined by dashes. Notice that the reformatting process should never produce any blocks of length 1 and produce at most two blocks of length 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the phone number after formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: number = \"1-23-45 6\"\n",
    "Output: \"123-456\"\n",
    "Explanation: The digits are \"123456\".\n",
    "Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\n",
    "Step 2: There are 3 digits remaining, so put them in a single block of length 3. The 2nd block is \"456\".\n",
    "Joining the blocks gives \"123-456\".\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: number = \"123 4-567\"\n",
    "Output: \"123-45-67\"\n",
    "Explanation: The digits are \"1234567\".\n",
    "Step 1: There are more than 4 digits, so group the next 3 digits. The 1st block is \"123\".\n",
    "Step 2: There are 4 digits left, so split them into two blocks of length 2. The blocks are \"45\" and \"67\".\n",
    "Joining the blocks gives \"123-45-67\".\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: number = \"123 4-5678\"\n",
    "Output: \"123-456-78\"\n",
    "Explanation: The digits are \"12345678\".\n",
    "Step 1: The 1st block is \"123\".\n",
    "Step 2: The 2nd block is \"456\".\n",
    "Step 3: There are 2 digits left, so put them in a single block of length 2. The 3rd block is \"78\".\n",
    "Joining the blocks gives \"123-456-78\".\n",
    "Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: number = \"12\"\n",
    "Output: \"12\"\n",
    "Example 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: number = \"--17-5 229 35-39475 \"\n",
    "Output: \"175-229-353-94-75\"\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "2 <= number.length <= 100\n",
    "number consists of digits and the characters '-' and ' '.\n",
    "There are at least two digits in number."
