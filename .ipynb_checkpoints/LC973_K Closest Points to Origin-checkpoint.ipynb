    "### LC973_K Closest Points to Origin\n",
    "We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1\n",
    "Output: [[-2,2]]\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
    "The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\n",
    "Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\n",
    "We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2\n",
    "Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\n",
