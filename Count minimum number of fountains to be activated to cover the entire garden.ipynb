    "### Count minimum number of fountains to be activated to cover the entire garden\n",
    "Difficulty Level : Hard\n",
    "There is a one-dimensional garden of length N. In each position of the N length garden, a fountain has been installed. Given an array a[]such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain. A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N). In beginning, all the fountains are switched off. The task is to find the minimum number of fountains needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: a[] = {1, 2, 1}\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "For position 1: a[1] = 1, range = 1 to 2\n",
    "For position 2: a[2] = 2, range = 1 to 3\n",
    "For position 3: a[3] = 1, range = 2 to 3\n",
    "Therefore, the fountain at position a[2] covers the whole garden.\n",
    "Therefore, the required output is 1.\n",
